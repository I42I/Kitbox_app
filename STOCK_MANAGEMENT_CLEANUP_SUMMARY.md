# Stock Management Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully cleaned up Stock management to have only one page with items display and quick stock check, removing "Check part availability" functionality, and ensuring everything is in English.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused ViewModels and Views
- **Deleted Files:**
  - `ViewModels/StockCheckerViewModel.cs` - Contained the "Check part availability" functionality
  - `ViewModels/StockManagementViewModel.cs` - Tab container that was no longer needed
  - `Views/StockCheckerView.axaml` and `Views/StockCheckerView.axaml.cs`
  - `Views/StockManagementView.axaml` and `Views/StockManagementView.axaml.cs`

### 2. Updated Dependency Injection
- **Modified:** `App.axaml.cs`
  - Removed registration of `StockCheckerViewModel` and `StockManagementViewModel`
  - Kept only `InventoryViewModel` for stock management functionality

### 3. Simplified Navigation
- **Modified:** `MainWindowViewModel.cs`
  - Updated `ShowStockManagement()` method to directly use `InventoryViewModel`
  - Changed status message from French to English: "Stock Management - Inventory and stock control"
  - Removed dependencies on the deleted ViewModels

### 4. Updated UI Language
- **Modified:** `Views/MainWindow.axaml`
  - Changed navigation button text from "Gestion du Stock" to "Stock Management"
  - Ensured all UI elements are in English

## Functionality After Cleanup

### Consolidated Stock Management Features
The stock management is now consolidated into a single `InventoryViewModel` that provides:

1. **Items Display:**
   - Complete inventory listing with search and filtering
   - Stock status indicators (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock)
   - Category-based filtering
   - Real-time stock level display

2. **Quick Stock Check:**
   - Instant visual stock status indicators
   - Summary cards showing total parts, in-stock count, low stock count, and out-of-stock count
   - Quick filtering options for low stock and out-of-stock items

3. **Stock Operations:**
   - Add stock functionality
   - Remove stock functionality
   - Stock level updates
   - Export inventory reports

### Removed Functionality
- ✅ **"Check part availability" feature** - This specific functionality has been completely removed

- ✅ **Tab-based stock management** - Simplified to single page interface

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

### Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity:** Fewer ViewModels and Views to maintain
- **Consistent Language:** All text now in English
- **Better Performance:** Removed unnecessary abstraction layers

## Verification

## Files Modified
