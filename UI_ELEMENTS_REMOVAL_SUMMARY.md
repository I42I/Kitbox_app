## Impact Assessment

### ‚úÖ What Still Works
- **4-Step Wizard Flow**: All steps remain functional (Basic Options ‚Üí Dimensions ‚Üí Accessories ‚Üí Review)
- **Color Selection**: Brown/White color options remain in Step 1
- **Number of Compartments**: Compartment configuration still works
- **Dimensions**: Width, Height, Depth inputs remain functional
- **Remaining Accessories**: "Include Doors" and "Include LED Lighting" options preserved
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons and step validation intact
- **Data Binding**: All remaining UI elements properly bound to ViewModel

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Was Removed
- **Cabinet Type Selection**: No longer able to choose between Standard/Corner/Wall cabinet types
- **Drawer Option**: Cannot include drawers in cabinet configuration  
- **Shelves Option**: Cannot include shelves in cabinet configuration
- **Related Data Collections**: Shelves inventory data no longer loaded

### üîß Technical Notes
- **Clean Removal**: All binding references eliminated to prevent runtime errors
- **Thread Safety**: Existing `SafeRaiseAndSetIfChanged` patterns preserved
- **Validation Logic**: Step validation logic unaffected
- **No Compilation Errors**: Build succeeds with only pre-existing warnings
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Configuration serialization may need updates if these properties were saved

## Verification Status
- ‚úÖ UI elements successfully removed from XAML
- ‚úÖ ViewModel properties cleaned up
- ‚úÖ No broken bindings detected
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors introduced
- ‚úÖ Application architecture preserved

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. **Test Configuration Flow**: Verify the 4-step wizard works end-to-end
2. **Check Serialization**: Ensure saved configurations don't reference removed properties
3. **Update Documentation**: Modify any user guides mentioning removed features
4. **Consider Future Extensibility**: Plan architecture for adding features back if needed
